As an End User I should be able to
Place a stream interactively in Microstation.

Comments:
This will be a very common way to store a new stream.

Implementation Details:
The end user will provide the following data to Microstation:
Riffle Width
Pool Width
Transition Length
Transition Distribution

Workflow:
1. Accept Initial DataPoint (DP).
2. First Dynamic DP intiates dynamics which show the first tangent.
3. The second DP accepts the point, stores the first tangent, and initiates Curve dynamics.
4. Subsequent Dynamic DPs show the following curve.
5. The next DP accepts the point, stores the next curve, and initiates Tangent dynamics.
6. Tangent dynamics draws the dynamic tangent and also modifies the length of the previously placed curve.
7. Return to placing curve by initiating Curve dynamics and returning to step 4.
The loop is exited by user sending Reset mouse button.

When in tangent dynamics, a DP sets the PC point of the next curve.
When in curve dynamics, a DP sets the PT point of the current curve.
When in tangent dynamics, both dynamic and final DP modify the previous curve's PT as needed to maintain tangency.

As the stream is being developed, Edge of Flow Bottom is drawn as the CL is drawn, including transition elements.
