User Story
EU1
As an End User I should be able to
promote a Microstation Selection Set to a RM21 Horizontal Alignment.

Comments:
The end user may start a new project at this point.  If a project does not exist in the current directory, the next one up is searched, up to two levels up.

If no project is found, a default project is created in the current directory.  This is silent in that the user is notified with a message in the ustn message field.
