Last Update: 2/22/2013

As an End User I should be able to
promote a Microstation Selection Set to a RM21 Horizontal Alignment.

Comments:
The end user may start a new project at this point.  If a project does not exist in the current directory, the next one up is searched, up to two levels up.  A project found up to that level will be used.

If no project is found, a default project is created in the current directory.  This is silent in that the user is notified with a message in the ustn message field.

Implementation Details:
The user selects one or more contiguous elements.  If these are not end to end, an error is reported.  If they are not lines, arcs, point curves, or b-splines, an error is reported.  Point curves and b-splines are only allowed to include euler spirals.  So these elements' non-conformity to euler spiral constraints also causes an error report.

The tool settings box has a text item for Alignment Name and one for Begin Station.  These are seeded with default values.  There is a toggle button (default=checked) labeled "Create Corridor".  It also has an Instruction Prompt text field.
If there is no legal selection set, the Instruction Prompt field says, "No Selection Set active." and DP'ing has no effect.  If a Selection Set is active and passes preliminary tests (by types of selected elements), then the Instruction Prompt text field states, "Data Point to Promote", which is also in the Prompt area.  This string is only present if there are no errors to report and the Promote action is allowed to proceed.

If the selected elements are already promoted, a message appears stating so, and the user is not allowed to do it again.

When the user is allowed to promote the elements, 
1) Upon user Data Point action (instructing the Promote action), rm21UstnSide composes the selected elements into a List<> and sends them through the interface to the project on the Model Side (rm21Core.dll).

2) rm21Core composes the raw data into a Horizontal Alignment.

3) If Create Corridor was checked on, rm21Core creates a Corridor for the HA and adds it to the projects list of allHorizontalAlignments.  If Create Corridor was checked off, rm21Core adds the HA to the Project's List<> of allUnassociatedHorizontalAlignments.

(The UnassociatedHorizontalAlignments List<> is a store of HAs that may later be promoted to Corridor or serve as an definingHA under a Corridor.  This will not be developed under EU1.)

4) The newly instantiated Corridor and its associated newly created HorizontalAlignment are stored in persistance, which is the dgn file, through an interface.  

Later, an approach will be developed to allow persistance to any dgn file.  So the currently active dgn file has to identify itself to the Core so that the dgn file path and name can be part of what is stored (not persistently) as part of a Corridor id.  When a file is opened anew, the Core model is reinstantiated anew.  (This may be optimized later to be less work and less time).  It is instantiated by populating all of the previously persisted corridors in the current dgn, and all persisted corridors in all reference files and nested reference files.

EU1_1 Promote a single Microstation Line to a RM21 Horizontal Alignment.
1.  User selects Line element.
2.  User activates PromoteToHorizontalAlignment command.
3.  rm21Ustn validates the selection set according to rules listed above.
4.  rm21Ustn composes instance of List<ustnFundamentalGeometry> from the selection set.
        (ustnFundamentalGeometry implements IRM21fundamentalGeometry) 
5.  rm21Ustn instantiates a rm21HorizontalAlignment by calling the constructor which uses List<IRM21fundamentalGeometry>.
6.  rm21Ustn persists the new instance in the current dgn model as part of the current rm21Project.
7.  rm21Ustn validates that the instance was persisted correctly and writes the persistance target dgnElement to the dgn file.
8.  rm21Ustn indicates to the end user that the elements have been promoted to an RM21 Horizontal Alignment.
