As an End User I should be able to
Extrude a Typical Section along a Horizontal Alignment.

Comments:
This act is the primary user action to start a new corridor.

Implementation Details:
When RM21 loads, it attempt to find and load the RM21 3D Typical Section.dgnlib.

From this file it finds the Level/Feature mapping as text elements in model "Level Mapping".  It also finds one or more typical section models.

When the user issues the Extrude command, rm21Ustn reads all line elements and tag elements from the Typical Section and compose them into some interface which rm21Core can map to a Corridor.  (Tag elements are used to indicate ribbon types other than Ribbon: Ray Sheet, Hinge Sheet, and Gore Sheet.)
[Cant do yet: Roadways with medians; Selecting between Cut Section and Fill Section.]

When the Extrude command successfully generates a Corridor, the new instance is passed back to rm21Ustn, at which point rm21Ustn requests Core to draw the Corridor.

When the Corridor is drawn, all elements are made part of the same Named Group in the pattern

RM21:corridorName:ribbonHashName

Ribbon Hash name is PGL Grouping number_Side_RibbonNumber, so it would look something like
RM21:L:-1_O_3

or

RM21:Y10:+1_I_2

Where +1 is the PGL Grouping id
O or I indicates the Outside ribbon collection or the Inside ribbon collection
2 or 3 or any other integer is the ribbon number of that ribbon collection.

The named groups are nested so that the user or an application can handle the whole corridor by selecting a single Named Group.
