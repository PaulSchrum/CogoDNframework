This repository is being deprecated in favor of a new one, CogoDN, which is target for .Net Core 3.1 or later. This repo was target for Framework, so it would not run anywhere. CogoND, being on Core, is intended to run on any OS supported by Core.

CogoDN is an Coordinate Geometry framework for Civil Engineers (Roadway and Railway) in Dot Net.  At this point it is still in development.  For example, there is no command line, and I am still working on a persistance approach.  For now I am using it just in support of research activities, but hopefully it will become more some day, maybe even the go-to Cogo framework for Dot Net.

Note Cogo has historically been the engineer's tool for Coordinate Geometry.  CogoDN is in no way associated with the Coalition of Geospatial Organizations, which also uses the abbreviation, COGO.  For the two names to be the same is coindicence.
