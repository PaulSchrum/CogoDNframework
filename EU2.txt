User Story
EU2
Last Update: 3/2/2013

As an End User I should be able to
open a Microstation dgn file, start RM21, and see a list of all Horizontal Alignments in the current dgn file and all of it Visible reference files.

Comments:
When a user first starts RM21, it loads all available information about the RM21 Project.  This User Story applies for a dgn file in which a project has already been established.

This User story's Implementation Details put forth how Projects are structured, including storage of horizontal alignments and corridors.

Implementation Details:
The Project is a class of RM21Core.  With one minor exception, all persisted storage of Projects and their corridors (etc.) occurs in the dgn file.  This is done via Named Groups (and nesting the named groups) and XML Element text persisting on the vector (visible) elements or on the Named Group.  

Duplicate storage is to be avoided.  The exemplar case of this is Horizontal Alignments.  All of the geometry information needed to store a HA is already encoded in the various dgn elements that represent it to the end user.  Therefore, those are used as well to represent the persistance of the HA to RM21core.  What is not stored and must be added to the persistance is the name of the alignment, plus some way of indicating that any given element is a member of any given alignment.

When RM21ustn starts up it looks for project information in the current dgn file active model and all of its visible reference models.  It collects all of this information and assembles it to instantiate a RM21 Project (residing in rm21Core).

RM21 Projects contain at least these:
rm21Surface existingGroundSurface;
List<rm21Corridor> allCorridors;
List<rm21HorizontalAlignment> allUnaffiliatedHorizontalAlignments;

If a HA is part of a Corridor, it is stored in that Corridor, otherwise it is kept in UnaffiliatedHAs.
